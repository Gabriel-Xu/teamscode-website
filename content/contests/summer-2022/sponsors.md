### About X-Camp Academy

X-Camp Academy was founded in August 2017 in Silicon Valley by two Google software
engineers. Their mission is to inspire and cultivate the next generation of computer science and artificial intelligence talents, which  they believe will have a positive impact on the future. The younger generations will have unlimited opportunities at X-Camp for many reasons.

They have a unique curriculum, inherited from Mr. Xianyou Xu, a Chinese diamond-level international gold medal coach. Mr. Xu has been training students to participate in programming competitions, especially Olympics in Informatics, for more than 20 years.

X-Camp prioritizes personalized education, with problem sets tailored to each student’s needs and an enrollment system that encourages grade skipping. By participating in team-based competitions and facilitating frequent group study sessions, X-Camp also fosters an environment of collaboration to build each student’s confidence in their ability to code.

X-Camp’s staff are composed of senior software engineers from major technology companies in Silicon Valley. They have strong support from international and domestic competition winners.

### About Wolfram

The Wolfram Language allows programmers to operate at a significantly higher level than ever before, by leveraging built-in computational intelligence that relies on a vast depth of algorithms and real-world knowledge carefully integrated over three decades. Scalable for programs from tiny to huge, with immediate deplovment locally and in the cloud, the Wolfram Language builds on clear principles-and an elegant unified symbolic structure-to create what is emerging as the world's most productive programming language and the first true computational communication language for humans and Als.
