## General Rules

<br>

* Only teams with only middle or high school students (rising 6th - senior) are eligible for prizes, however everyone (college students, workers) is welcome to compete.
* Each team may have up to 4 people. Team members may not receive any help from anyone outside of their team.
* Teams may use multiple computers and submit answers in multiple languages.
* Pre-written code and online reference guides are allowed (Essentially internet is allowed as long as you’re not asking people how to solve our problem).
* There are three divisions: **Novice**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**. We expect each division will be interesting for participants of the following skill levels:
  * The novice division is intended for students who know programming but have not started or have just started competitive programming:
    * Taking or have taken APCS
    * USACO Bronze-Silver
    * 0 - 1300 Codeforces rating
  * The intermediate division is intended for students with some competitive programming experience:
    * USACO Silver to Gold
    * 1000 - 1800 Codeforces rating
  * The advanced division is intended for anyone who is confident in their competitive programming ability:
    * USACO Gold and above
    * 1600+ Codeforces rating
* Contest page [https://contest.teamscode.org](https://contest.teamscode.org)
* Join our discord server here: [https://go.teamscode.org/discord](https://go.teamscode.org/discord) for important contest announcements or if you have any questions.
* Try more problems from the last contest:
  * <https://codeforces.com/gym/103643>
  * You will need to make a codeforces account: <https://codeforces.com/register>

<br>

## Problem Format

<br>

* Description: an overview of the problem.
* Input Format: specifies how the input will be formatted, including constraints on the size of parameters. (constraints may be stated in the Description).
* Output Format: specifies how the output should be formatted - if you don’t follow this format exactly, your answer will most likely be marked as incorrect.
* Sample Input: provides a sample input to help you test your code.
* Sample Output: provides the expected output to the sample input.
* Sample Explanation: provides an explanation of how the sample output was obtained from the sample input.

<br>

## Submitting Solutions

<br>

* Allowed Languages: C++, C, Java, Python 2, Python 3
* Solutions will be submitted through the contest page listed above. The code for each problem should be copy-pasted into the box that appears after clicking “Submit Code”.
* For Java submissions, the class name of your main function must be ```Main```.
* The file size containing your code must not exceed 50 KB.
* Default Constraints
  * Note that constraints may vary depending on the problem.
  * Time Limit: Your program must run in under 2,000 ms (2 seconds) for C and C++, under 4,000 ms (4 seconds) for Java, and under 8,000 ms (8 seconds) for Python.  Time limits for each language may be different if specified in a problem.
  * Memory Limit: The program's memory must not exceed 256 MB
* Use **Standard Input** in your code. This means that test cases are directly typed into the console. Here’s an example for each of the allowed languages:<br>**Java:** `Scanner(System.in)`  **C++:** `cin>>` **Python:** `input()`    **C:** `scanf()`
* Use **Standard Output** in your code. This means that the output directly prints to the console. Here’s what standard output looks like for each of the languages:<br>**Java:** `System.out.println()`  **C++:** `cout<<` **Python:** `print()` **C:** `printf()`

<br>

## Scoring

<br>

### Problem Difficulty

* There are ~10 total problems in ascending order of difficulty.

### Problem Points

* All problems are each worth 100 points. Each problem has some number of tests (usually 10 or 20). Sample test is worth 0 point. If you solve X non-sample tests correctly for a problem with Y non-sample tests, you get (X/Y * 100) points.
* Note that each test may have multiple test cases where each test case must be solved correctly to get points for the test.
* Output must match **exactly** with expected output to receive points for the test case - there is no partial credit.

### Problem Tests

* The first test is always the sample given in the problem.
* Some problems will have explicitly stated subtasks. For example, a problem with 10 tests may have tests 1-5 with N<=10 and tests 6-10 with N<=100.

### Ties

* Ties will be broken by the timestamp on the last submission that increases your total score.

<br>

## Prizes

<br>

* $4500+ in Amazon gift cards, raffle prizes, and Wolfram|Alpha Notebook Edition.
* The top 5 scoring teams from the advanced division, top 4 from the intermediate division, and top 4 from the novice division will win amazon gift cards as well as a Wolfram|Alpha Notebook Edition. The exact amounts each team member will win is listed here:
  <br>**Advanced**
  * 1st: $50 each
  * 2nd: $40 each
  * 3rd: $30 each
  * 4th: $25 each
  * 5th: $20 each
  **Intermediate**
  * 1st: $20 each
  * 2nd: $20 each
  * 3rd: $10 each
  * 4th: $10 each
  **Novice**
  * 1st: $15 each
  * 2nd: $10 each
  * 3rd: $10 each
  * 4th: $10 each
* Everyone in your team will earn one raffle ticket once you submit your first solution.
* Raffle prizes will be drawn in the last half hour of the contest using a random number generator - we will email those selected for shipment details immediately following the contest.
* We all still finalizing raffle prize details.
