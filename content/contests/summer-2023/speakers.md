Michael Plunkett is an experienced software engineer of 10+ years and a second-year graduate student at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago. At the University of Chicago, he is pursuing a Master of Science in Computational Analysis and Public Policy, a joint degree between the public policy and computer science schools. He left the software engineering industry in the Fall of 2022 to return to school to apply his technical skills in the areas he is particularly passionate about, specifically police accountability, alternatives to policing, reproductive rights, and voting equity. In his off-time, he likes to read sci-fi, consume far too much of the New Yorker, and work his way up and down Chicago's Lakeside Drive while running or biking.
