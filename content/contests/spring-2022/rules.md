## General Rules

<br>

* Only middle or high school students (rising 6th - senior) are eligible for prizes, however everyone (college students, workers) is welcome to compete.
* May not receive any help from anyone outside of their team.
* Teams may use multiple computers and submit answers in multiple languages.
* Pre-written code and online reference guides are allowed (Essentially internet is allowed as long as you’re not asking people how to solve our problem).
* There are **three divisions**: **Novice**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**. The novice division is intended for students who know programming (taking or have taken APCS/USACO Bronze-Silver) but have not started competitive programming; the intermediate division is intended for students with some competitive programming experience(USACO Silver to Gold); the advanced division is intended for anyone who is confident in their competitive programming ability (USACO Gold and above).
* Contest page [https://contest.teamscode.org](https://contest.teamscode.org)
* Join our discord server here: [https://discord.com/invite/8pg89SS](https://discord.com/invite/8pg89SS) for important contest announcements or if you have any questions.

<br>

## Problem Format

<br>

* Description: an overview of the problem.
* Input Format: specifies how the input will be formatted, including constraints on the size of parameters.
* Output Format: specifies how the output should be formatted - if you don’t follow this format exactly, your answer will most likely be marked as incorrect.
* Sample Input: provides a sample input to help you test your code.
* Sample Output: provides the expected output to the sample input.

<br>

## Submitting Solutions

<br>

* Allowed Languages: C++, C, Java, Python 2, Python 3
* Solutions will be submitted through the contest page listed above. The code for each problem should be copy-pasted into the box that appears after clicking “Submit Code”.
* For Java submissions, the class name of your main function must be ```Main```.
* The file size containing your code must not exceed 50 KB.
* Your program must run in under 2,000 ms (2 seconds) for C and C++, under 4,000 ms (4 seconds) for Java, and under 8,000 ms (8 seconds) for Python.  Time limits for each language may be different if specified in a problem.
* The program's memory must not exceed 256 MB
* Use **Standard Input** in your code. This means that test cases are directly typed into the console. Here’s an example for each of the allowed languages:<br>**Java:** `Scanner(System.in)`  **C++:** `cin>>` **Python:** `input()`    **C:** `scanf()`
* Use **Standard Output** in your code. This means that the output directly prints to the console. Here’s what standard output looks like for each of the languages:<br>**Java:** `System.out.println()`  **C++:** `cout<<` **Python:** `print()` **C:** `printf()`

<br>

## Scoring

<br>

* Novice/Intermediate/Advanced: There are 15 total problems in ascending order of difficulty.
* Novice/Intermediate/Advanced: Each problem has 10 test cases. Easy problem test cases are worth **10 points** each, Medium problem test cases are worth **20 points** each, and Hard problem test cases are worth **30 points** each — Maximum of 3,000 points if all problems are correct.
* Output must match **exactly** with expected output to receive points for the test case - there is no partial credit.
* Ties will be broken by the timestamp on the last submission that increases your total score.

<br>
