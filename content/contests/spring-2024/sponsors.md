### About X-Camp Academy

X-Camp Academy was founded in August 2017 in Silicon Valley by two Google software
engineers. Their mission is to inspire and cultivate the next generation of computer science and artificial intelligence talents, which  they believe will have a positive impact on the future. The younger generations will have unlimited opportunities at X-Camp for many reasons.

They have a unique curriculum, inherited from Mr. Xianyou Xu, a Chinese diamond-level international gold medal coach. Mr. Xu has been training students to participate in programming competitions, especially Olympics in Informatics, for more than 20 years.

X-Camp prioritizes personalized education, with problem sets tailored to each student’s needs and an enrollment system that encourages grade skipping. By participating in team-based competitions and facilitating frequent group study sessions, X-Camp also fosters an environment of collaboration to build each student’s confidence in their ability to code.

X-Camp’s staff are composed of senior software engineers from major technology companies in Silicon Valley. They have strong support from international and domestic competition winners.

### About Desmos

Desmos Studio is a Public Benefit Corporation with a goal of helping everyone learn math, love math, and grow with math. We believe that everyone has an inner mathematician and that some people haven’t been given the opportunity, encouragement, or tools to discover theirs. So we prioritize equity and accessibility at every level of our work.

Our free suite of math tools, including our Graphing Calculator, is used annually by over 75 million people around the world. Those tools help people represent their ideas mathematically, connect different representations dynamically, make conjectures, and then develop entirely new ideas. They also result in some pretty spectacular art.

We partner with the world's most popular curricula and learning software, and with the majority of U.S. state-level assessments and digital college entrance exams.
